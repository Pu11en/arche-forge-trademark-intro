## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.20.0 or higher
- npm 9.0.0 or higher
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/asset-marketing-studio.git
   cd asset-marketing-studio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical fixes for production

### Creating a New Feature

1. Create a new branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the coding standards defined in `.editorconfig`

3. Test your changes locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a pull request to `develop`

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. All PRs must pass automated checks
2. At least one team member must approve the PR
3. PRs should be small and focused on a single feature or fix
4. Update documentation as needed

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed
- [ ] Performance implications are considered
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for user flows
- Visual regression tests for UI components
- Performance testing for critical paths

## Deployment

### Staging Deployment

1. Merge PR to `develop`
2. Automatic deployment to staging environment
3. QA testing on staging
4. Approval for production deployment

### Production Deployment

1. Create a release branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
   ```

2. Update version numbers in `package.json`

3. Merge to `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v1.0.0
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

4. Automatic deployment to production

## Release Process

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Checklist

- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] Version is updated in package.json
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Deployment to staging is verified
- [ ] Production deployment is successful

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```
